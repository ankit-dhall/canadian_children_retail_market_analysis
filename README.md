## Project Overview

This project analyzes the Canadian census dataset for 2016 published by Statistics Canada and aims to understand the children's retail market in order to help set up new store locations.

This analysis would help businesses understand it's potential consumers, population distribution, purchase powers, and potential opportunities while setting up retail stores or rolling out new products to market.

In general, this particular analysis looks at different components of the Canadian census statistics to answer a few main business objectives:

* Analyze Canadian children's population across Canada to optimize retail locations
* Understand population and gender distributions to devise product stocking strategies
* Potential of setting up online stores to cater to certain age groups 
* Analyze median incomes across top prospective cities
* Understand languages spoken in cities of interest

## Data Description

The data has been provided by Statistics Canada. While the Canadian census caters data across multiple variables, specific data files were utilized in order to answer business objectives.

Collectively, 4 data files have been utilized and the raw data files can be accessed here [Raw Data](https://github.com/ankit-dhall/canadian_children_retail_market_analysis/tree/main/raw_data)

These data files have been extensively cleaned on MS Excel and SAS and used for further analysis. The cleaned data files can be found here [Cleaned Data](https://github.com/ankit-dhall/canadian_children_retail_market_analysis/tree/main/cleaned_data)

Finally, the output files generated as a result of the analysis done on SAS have been exported and can be accessed here. [Output Data](https://github.com/ankit-dhall/canadian_children_retail_market_analysis/tree/main/output_data)
These files were further used for creating visualizations using Tableau
